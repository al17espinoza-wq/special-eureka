To the hiring manager at LUMA
Welcome to my github!

I just created my github a few days ago (I am currently teaching myself fullstack development) so this may not be very impressive.

I hope you have just a moment to read this message, as it was intentionally made for the application for customer support specialist at Luma!

As I read through the job listing, I honestly didn't know where to start. The "You might really thrive here if..." section spoke to me the most though so I can tackle that.
  
  I love AI, and love experimenting with new tools (hence this different style of "cover letter"). I love playing with AI features that come out, as well as different tech that interests me.
 
  I thrive in startup environments, I have been a part of three startup companies and I enjoyed every quirk and experience I had in each of those companies. My previous role was with an AI healthcare tech company and
  the skills and experience from that position is something I will be very grateful for for the rest of my professional life.
 
  I solved problems in my last job, but the immediate impact was not always experienced in my department, as we worked on the backend of the projects. So to have the ability to experience first hand the impact of my 
  contributions will be very rewarding.

I could go on and talk about each point in the job listing, but I won't do that to you. I am sure you have many resume's to read, so I will wrap it up.
  
  
  I have many years of various types of customer support, in person and virtually. It may not reflect in a traditional way in my job experience, but I am confident that my skills will transfer to this role satisfactorily. 

I would love to have a conversation about more of my qualifications, and would happily take time for a meeting or phone call if you have any questions. 

I hope to hear back from you, I can be reached at al17espinoza@gmail.com or my cell at 801-660-7087.

Thank you again for taking some time reading this, I appreciate the opportunity to try something new and shake up the application process a bit.

Kind regards,
Alexis Espinoza
